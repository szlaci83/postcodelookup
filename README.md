# Postcode lookup

Simple program to test the getAddress.io API for postcode lookup.
Uses free key to use the service and gets a JSON object as 
a response. Uses String methods to cut off the not required parts and
split the addresses into a String array. Later this array can be used 
as a dropdown list to select the address.
